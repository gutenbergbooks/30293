<p>In presenting this selection of choice recipes
for Candy Makers we have endeavored to avoid
everything that is not practical and easy to
understand. The recipes given are from the most
experienced and notable candy makers of America
and Europe, and are such, that, if followed out
with care and attention will be sure to lead to success.
Practice is only to be had by experiment,
and little failures are overcome by constant
perseverance.</p>

<p>After the rudiments have been thoroughly
mastered, the reader has ample scope to distinguish
himself in the Candy world, and will do so
with patience and perseverance. We trust our
patrons will look upon this work, not as a literary
effort, but as instruction from a practical
workman to a would-be workman.</p>

<h2><a name="SUGAR_BOILING" id="SUGAR_BOILING"></a>SUGAR BOILING.</h2>


<p>This branch of the trade or business of a confectioner
is perhaps the most important. All
manufacturers are more or less interested in it, and
certainly no retail shop could be considered orthodox
which did not display a tempting variety of this class.
So inclusive is the term "boiled goods" that it embraces
drops, rocks, candies, taffies, creams, caramels, and a
number of different sorts of hand-made, machine-made,
and moulded goods. It is the most ancient method of
which we have any knowledge, and perhaps the most
popular process of modern times; the evidence of our
everyday experience convinces us that (notwithstanding
the boom which heralds from time to time a new sweet,
cooked in a different manner, composed of ingredients
hitherto unused in business), it is the exception when
such goods hold the front rank for more than a few
months, however pretty, tasty, or tempting they may
be, the public palate seems to fall back on those made in
the old lines which, though capable of improvement,
seem not to be superceded. Of the entire make of confectionery
in Canada, at least two-thirds of it may be
written down under the name of boiled sugar. They
are undoubtedly the chief features with both manufacturers
and retailers, embracing, as they do, endless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>facilities for fertile brains and deft fingers for inventing
novelties in design, manipulation, combination, and
finish. Notwithstanding the already great variety,
there is always daily something new in this department
brought into market. Many of the most successful
houses owe their popularity more to their heads than
their hands, hence the importance of studying this
branch in all its ramifications. The endless assortment
requiring different methods for preparing and manipulating
make it necessary to sub-divide this branch into
sections, order and arrangement being so necessary to
be thoroughly understood. <i>When we consider the few
inexpensive tools required to make so many kinds of saleable
goods, it is not to be wondered at so many retailers
have a fancy to make their own toffees and such like, there
is no reason why a man or woman, with ordinary patience,
a willing and energetic disposition, favored with a fair
amount of intelligence, should not be able to become with
the aid of THIS BOOK and a few dollars for tools, fairly
good sugar boilers, with a few months practice.</i></p>

<p>There are reasons why a retail confectioner should
study sugar boiling. It gives character to the business,
a fascinating odour to the premises, and a general at-homeness
to the surroundings. No goods look more
attractive and tempting to the sweet eating public than
fresh made goods of this kind. A bright window can
be only so kept by makers. Grainy or sticky drops
may be reboiled; scraps and what would otherwise be
almost waste (at least unsightly) may be redressed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>another shape, and become, not only saleable, but profitable.
<i>There are many advantages which a maker
possesses over one who buys all.</i> For instance, clear boiled
goods should be kept air tight, and are therefore
delivered to the retailers in bottles, jars, or tins, on
which charge is made, these have to be repacked and
returned. Breakages are an important item, so is
freight&mdash;the cost of the latter is saved and the former
reduced to a minimum.</p>

<p>Whatever means are adopted to benefit the retailer
and advertise the business by brighter windows, cleaner
shops, less faded goods, and healthier financial conditions
must contribute to the general prosperity of the
trade, from the bottom step to the top rung of the
ladder.</p>

<p>It should be the aim of all amateurs to study
quality rather than price. Goods well made, carefully
flavored, and nicely displayed will always command a
ready sale at a fair price, giving satisfaction to the consumer
and credit to the maker. Give your customers
something to please the eye as well as the palate, so
that every sale may be looked upon as an advertisement.
Cheap, bulky, insipid stuff is unprofitable and
damaging to the trade as well as to the seller. I
venture to assert that more would-be makers have come
to grief trying to cut each other in price for rubbishy
candies than through any other cause. Look at the
number of firms who have a reputation, whose very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
name command trade at good prices, year after year add
to the turnover. What is the talisman? Look at their
goods. There is perhaps nothing very striking in them,
but they are <i>invariably good</i>, busy or slack they are
made with care, packed with taste, and delivered neatly
in a business-like fashion. Compare this to our makers
of cheap stuff; to obtain orders they sell at unprofitable
prices, often at a loss, and try to make up the difference
by resorting to various methods of increasing the bulk,
the result is ultimate ruin to themselves, loss to their
creditors, and injury to every one concerned. Few who
read these lines will not be able to verify all that is
stated. The writer's advice has always been to keep up
a <i>high degree of excellence, try to improve in every direction,
and success is only a matter of patience, energy and
civility</i>.</p>

<p>It is not intended to give a complete list of all kinds
of candy known in the trade, that would be absurd and
impossible. To be able to make any particular kind
will require knowledge only to be gained by experience,
so that much depends on the thoughtful endeavor of the
beginner.</p>


<h3>THE WORKSHOP.</h3>

<p>Sugar boiling, like every other craft, requires a
place to do it, fitted with tools and appliances. The
requisites and requirements can be easily suited to the
purse of the would-be confectioner.
A work to be useful to all must cater for all, and include
information which will be useful to the smaller
storekeeper as well as the larger maker. To begin at
the bottom, one can easily imagine a person whose only
ambition is to make a little candy for the window fit for
children. This could be done with a very small outlay
for utensils. The next move is the purchase of a sugar
boiler's furnace not very costly and certainly indispensable
where quality and variety are required, it will be
a great saving of time as well as money, the sugar will
boil a much better color, so that cheaper sugar may be
used for brown or yellow goods, while one can make
acid drops and other white goods from granulated.
Dutch crush, or loaf sugar, which would be impossible
to make on a kitchen stove from any sort of sugar.</p>

<p>We cannot go any further into the mysteries of
this art successfully unless we provide ourselves with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>candy machine and rolls to enable us to make drops.
<i>They are indispensable</i>, and if we are to go on, we must
have them to enable us to make drops, and every confectioner
sells drops. These machines are made to suit
all classes of trade, big and little. The small ones make
just as nice drops as the large ones, and will turn out in
the course of a day 2 or 3 cwt., by constant use, so that
for retail purposes this quantity would generally be
sufficient.</p>

<p>These Machines are made to fit a Standard Gauge, and will

<p>Having so far got our workshop arranged the next
thing is to keep it in order. Sugar boiling is dirty
sticky business, especially on wet days, unless every
part is kept scrupulously clean and dry, slabs and
tables should be washed, no trace of sifting, scraps, or
boiled goods, should be left exposed to the atmosphere
during the night, the floor well swept, and a little clean
sawdust put down every night.</p>

<p>The comfort and ease in working in a clean place far
more than offsets the trouble and time it takes to put it
in order, besides the goods are much drier, brighter and
easier to bottle or pack. Nothing is more unpleasant
than to work with sticky slabs, slimy machines or dirty
scales. The boil adheres to the slabs, sticks to the
rollers, spoiling the shapes, and become cloudy and
spotty in weighing. We are not writing without knowledge.
Any one who has worked or visited small
workshops can endorse the value of these remarks, and
call to mind this imaginary picture. However, there
are exceptions, still the hint will be useful in a good
many cases.</p>

<h3>METHOD OF SUGAR BOILING.</h3>

<p>If the learner will study the following instructions,
the author guarantees to place him in a position to boil
sugar as correctly as the most experienced workman.
To accomplish this, the reader should provide himself
with the sugar boiler's tools named on the preceding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>page. While the sugar is undergoing the process of
boiling, it is almost impossible for a learner to determine
the exact degree which the sugar has attained
without a thermometer, and even the journeyman finds
it so useful that you will find very few indeed who boil
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>sugar without it; in fact many of the larger shops will
not allow a sugar boiler to work without one. For
almost any purpose the following degrees will be found
all that is necessary. For instance put into the pan in
which you intend to boil, 7 lbs. granulated sugar together
with one quart of water, placing it on the fire
and allow it to boil. Put a cover over the pan and
allow it to boil for ten minutes; then take off the cover
and put the thermometer in the pan, immersing the
bottom part of it in the boiling sugar, and let it remain
there until the sugar is boiled to the degree you require.
The following five degrees are those used by confectioners
for different purposes:</p>

<p>1st. The smooth, viz.,&mdash;215 to 220 by the thermometer.
When the mercury registers these figures the
sugars may then be used for crystalizing creams, gum
goods and liqueurs.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>
<p>2nd. The Thread, viz., 230 and 235 is the degree
which is used for making liqueurs.</p>

<p>3rd. The Feather, viz., 240 to 245. Only a few
minutes elapse between these degrees, and the sugar
must be watched closely during the boiling at this point.
This degree may be used for making fondants, rich
creams, cream for chocolates and fruit candying.</p>

<p>4th. The Ball, viz., 250 to 255. The sugar at this
point is used for making cocoanut and other candies,
cocoanut ice, and almost every description of grain
sugar generally.</p>

<p>5th. The Crack, viz., 310 to 315. This is the degree
which is used, with little variation, for all kinds of
drops, taffies, and all clear goods, whether for the purpose
of passing through machines or manipulating with
the hands.</p>

<p>These degrees can be tested by an experienced hand
without the aid of the thermometer, and the learner may
accustom himself by trying them in the following manner:
Take the stem of a clay pipe and dip it into the
sugar as it boils, draw it out again and pass it through
the forefinger and thumb; when it feels oily you will
find by looking at your thermometer that it has reached
the degree of smooth, 215 to 220 by the glass.</p>

<p>The next degree or thread, may be tried by your
taking a little of the sugar off the pipe between your
finger and thumb and part them gently; if you see small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>threads hang between your finger and thumb that
degree has arrived.</p>

<p>For the degree of Ball, 250 to 255, you must have
by your hand a small jug of cold water; when you draw
the pipe out of the sugar dip it in the water, and when
taken out of the water, if you can work it like a piece of
putty, you have got the degree of ball.</p>

<p>The degree of Crack must be tested the same way,
and the sugar must leave the pipe clean; dip it again into
cold water; when off the pipe break off a piece with
your teeth; if it snaps clean in your teeth, pour your
sugar on the slab at once.</p>

<p>NOTE.&mdash;This last degree must be tried sharply, in
giving the process for trying it without the thermometer.
We caution all beginners to get a thermometer, as
practice alone can instruct you without. It is also
necessary to state that thermometers differ a little, and
should be tested.</p>

<p>During hot weather, it is necessary to bring the
sugars up to the full degree; during winter months, the
lower degrees marked will answer the purpose.</p>


<h3>CUTTING THE GRAIN, LOWERING OR GREASING.</h3>

<p>Almost all sugar, especially refined, whether loaf,
crystalized or granulated, and most sugars known to
the trade as pieces will, if boiled beyond the degree
of ball, or 250 by the thermometer, when turned out
of the pan becomes cloudy, then grainy, and ultimately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
a solid lump of hard opaque sugar. To prevent
this candying, as it is called several agents are used,
such as glucose, cream of tartar pyroligneous acid, vinegar
&amp;c., the action of which will cause the sugar to boil
clear, be pliable while hot and transparent when
cold. It is therefore necessary to use some lowering
agent for all boilings intended for clear goods, such
as drops, taffies, rocks. &amp;c.</p>

<p>Experience has taught most of the old hands that
two of these agents possess all the merits necessary for
the purpose, and are to be preferred to others for reasons
it is unnecessary to state&mdash;they are cream of tartar and
glucose. A great deal could be said in favor of either
or both; cream of tartar is handier and cleaner to use
as well as more exact in its action; goods boiled with it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>will be a better color and, some assert, more crisp; for
acids and all best and export goods it is to be recommended&mdash;use
a proportion of half an ounce to every 14
lbs. of sugar&mdash;we say about, as some strong sugars
require a little more, this is generally measured in a
teaspoon, two spoonfuls to every 14 lbs. of sugar.</p>

<p><i>Glucose</i>, being cheaper than sugar, is valuable to the
confectioner, not only for its lowering qualities, but also
as a bulk producer, <i>reducing the cost of the product</i>. On
this account there is a tendency to overdo it by using too
much, the result causing goods to become sticky and
turn soft immediately they are exposed to the atmosphere,
not only so, but we have seen drops running to
a solid lump in bottles through being overdosed. If
glucose is used in proper proportions, it makes an excellent
lowering agent, and will answer the purpose first
rate for ordinary drops and the like. Use three lbs. of
glucose to every 14 lbs. of sugar; keep a panful on the
furnace top, so that it will always be hot and may be
easily measured by means of a saucepan or ladle holding
the exact quantity; add the glucose when sugar begins
to boil.</p>


<h3>FLAVORS AND COLORS.</h3>

<p>These form almost as important a part of the trade
as the sugar itself, and it should be the chief object of
every workman to try and excel in these two important
features; if you do not use <i>good flavors</i>, it is a moral
certainty you cannot produce <i>good candies</i>. Flavors for
boiled sugars should be specially prepared, those bought
at an ordinary <i>chemist shop may do very well for flavoring
</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span><i>
custards and pastry, but are of no use for boiled sugars, in
fact better use no essence at all, as they</i> are so weak that, to
give the drops &amp;c., even a slight taste the quantity required
reduces the degree to which the sugar has been
boiled so much that it works like putty, and sticks to
the machine while being pressed through; the drops
when finished look dull, dragged and stick together
when bottled; tons of drops are weekly spoiled by small
makers using such flavors, while a little trouble and less
expense would put them out of their misery, besides
giving to the goods that clear bright dry appearance
to be found in the drops of a respectable house.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that the flavor is the very life
of the candy. Color may please the eye, but excellence
in that alone is not all that is required. A buyer may be
attracted by the eye, but he does not eat with it. Neither
old or young would knowingly eat only colored sugar.
A sweet taste may be satisfied with sugar alone.</p>

<p>It is the variety of pleasant flavors that is desired and
it is the business of the confectioner to supply it. Flavors
for sugar boiling should be as concentrated as it is possible
for it to be. Several large houses who have confined
their attention to the wants and requirements of
the confectionery and mineral water trades have succeeded
in producing fruit essences of quality, which is a
pleasure to work with. Being very powerful, little is required
to give the boil rich flavor, consequently it passes
through the machine easily, forming a perfect drop on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>which the clear imprint of the engraving characteristic of
the machine used. Essential oils used by confectioners are
those having an agreeable aromatic flavor, and should
be used in their original strength, without being adulterated
or reduced. It is absolutely necessary that they
should be pure and fresh, more particularly the oils of
lemon and orange, as when not fresh and pure they partake
of the flavor of turpentine, and are particularly
unpleasant to the taste.</p>

<p>Small makers would do well to buy carefully from a
good house not more than would be used up in two or
three months, especially the two before mentioned.
Some oils on the contrary, improve by keeping such as
peppermint and lavender. All essences and oils are best
kept well corked in a cool dark place.</p>

<p>These oils being powerful, popular and expensive,
they are frequently adulterated. Cream of tartar and
tartaric acid on account of the price is often increased,
the former with different cheap powders, the latter
usually with alum. Many people fail in the process
through no fault of their own, but simply through their
being supplied with inferior ingredients, it is therefore
of importance, that colors and flavors should be purchased
at some respectable house; get list of oils'
extracts and essences from Fletcher Mnf'g. Co. who are
large dealers in these goods.</p>

<p>The colors prepared, consisting of several very nice
shades of yellow and red, also coffee brown, jetoline
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>black, damson blue, and apple green; they are in paste,
ready for use, being vegetable, they are guaranteed
strictly wholesome, and may be used with confidence.</p>


<h3>WRINKLES WORTH READING ON SUGAR BOILING.</h3>

<p>To make an acid drop to perfection, the pan must
not only be clean but bright; use best white sugar, and
just enough water to melt it, with a little extra cream
of tartar (no glucose); boil on a sharp fire to 305; after
passing through machine, well dust with icing sugar
and bottle. Beginners should not try to work with
less water, as the boil is more liable to grain, which can
be seen by an expert and avoided. Before putting on
the boil see that there is sufficient fuel on the furnace
to carry through the operation. To make up a fire during
the process spoils the color and quality. The sharper the
sugar is boiled the better the appearance and durability.</p>

<p>When boiling common sugars have the pan large
enough,&mdash;some throw up a good deal of foam when they
reach the boiling point and are liable to flow over&mdash;watch
closely, and if unable to beat the foam down, lift the pan
on the side of the fire a few minutes until boiled through.</p>

<p>Many weak sugars burn on a clear fire before they
come to a degree of crack. In this case sprinkle a little
fresh fuel or ashes over the fire and replace the pan
again. Should it again catch, repeat the operation nursing
it up to the desired degree. Bad boiling sugar is very
troublesome. A good plan is to make a rule of straining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>the batch just after it boils, through a very fine copper
wire or hair sieve, this prevents foreign matter
such as grit, saw dust or even nails, which is often
mixed with the sugar getting into the goods. Keep
thermometer when not in use in jar of water standing on
the furnace plate by the side of the pan, wash out the jar
and fill with cold water every morning; keep the thermometer
clean, especially the top part, as the sugar
which adheres to it becomes grainy, and might spoil a
whole boil. After making many dark candies thoroughly
wash the thermometer before putting into a light
boil.</p>

<p>In using colors for drops and clear goods, use them
in the form of a paste where practicable, then you can
mix them in when the boil is on the slab, thus saving
your pan; keep the colors damp in jars, look over them
every night, and, where necessary, add a little cold water
to keep them moist, or the top may get dry and hard,
which would make the goods specky. Use a separate
piece of stick for each color to rub in with, and be careful
not to use too much color; a very little goes a long
way with clear boiled goods. Goods are more often
spoiled by using too much than too little; more can
always be added if the shades are too light, but there is
no remedy if you have added too much. When coloring
taffies, this must be done in the pan; liquid colors
are best; trouble will be saved if used in the following
order. Suppose Raspberry, Everton and Lemon taffies
were wanted, make the Lemon taffy first, add saffron
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>just before the boil is ready, then the lemon, and pour
out; make the Everton taffy next in the same way, add
the butter before the lemon; then make the Raspberry.
In this arrangement there is no necessity of steaming out
the pan. Had the Raspberry taffy been made first,
the pan would have to be cleaned out before the Lemon
or Everton taffy could have been made, because it would
have been red.</p>

<p>Measure the flavors in a graduated glass; wash out
the glass frequently, or it will get rancid; weigh the
acid and see that it is well ground; if it has become dry
and lumpy, rub it down to a powder with a rolling pin
or heavy bottle on a sheet of paper before using. In
using fruit essences a little powdered tartaric acid
throws up the flavor, half the essences will have a better
effect. Put the acid on the boil after it has been poured
on the slab in a little heap, and pour the essence over it,
then thoroughly incorporate the whole.</p>

<p>Use the best oil for the slab with a clean flannel
cloth; keep the cloth in a saucer, if it lies about it falls
on the floor and picks up dirt and carries it to the pouring
plate. When it gets hard or gritty burn it at once
and get a new one, or it may be used by mistake and
make a mess. We have seen the beauty of a boil spoilt
scores of times by using dirty rags and rancid oil. A
sugar boiler cannot be too careful in these little details,
the success of his work largely depends upon it. It is
easy to inaugurate a good system, and much more comfortable
to work to it than a slovenly "what shall I do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>next" sort of a method. Know where to find and put
your hand on everything; when the boil is hot there is
no time to look for what you require. "A place for
everything and everything in its place" should be a
practical feature in every boiling shop.</p>


<h3>STICKY CANDIES.</h3>

<p>Perhaps there is nothing more annoying to the
trade than sticky boiled sugars. All clear goods when
exposed to the atmosphere will turn damp, especially
in wet weather. It is a question of degree, some slightly
and some will run almost to syrup; it is impossible to
obviate the former but the latter can be prevented.
Great care should be used in adding the lowering,
whether cream of tartar or glucose, too much of either
will cause the goods to run immediately after they are
turned out. Weak or inferior sugars, or not sufficient
boiling, has also this effect. We know of no reliable
agent which will altogether prevent this result but we
do know that a careful arrangement of the different
proportions, using good sugar and well boiling greatly
mitigate, if not altogether prevent the grievance.
Goods intended for exposure should contain just sufficient
lowering to prevent the boil from growing grainy and
boiled right up to the standard. Of course different
sugars will carry more or less lowering, but this can be
easily tested by the workman. A few experiments will
determine the exact quantity for each boil. There is
no excuse for drops sticking in bottles when corked,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>this should not occur, if it does, the fault is in the making;
the water has a great deal to do with causing the
candies to be sticky. The writer has experienced this
in several country places, where the only supply of this
indispensable ingredient was drawn from the artesian
wells. To look at it, it was all that could be desired&mdash;a
beautiful, cold, clear and wholesome beverage. Of its
chemical constituents I do not pretend to give an
opinion, but the drops and other clear boils for which it
was used got damp directly after they were exposed,
and would have run to a syrup had they not been
covered up. The goods keep all right in bottles, but it
is very annoying, not to speak of the injury and loss to
a business, when this is the position with regard to the
water supply. The only remedy we could suggest, and
which was very successful, was powdered borax. We
used this in the proportion of a teaspoonful to every
14 lbs. of sugar adding it just as the sugar began to boil.
Borax has been found useful with any water when making
goods to be exposed in the window or on the
counters, such as taffies, rocks and clear boiled sugars
generally. Where the supply of water, as in most large
towns is suitable, given good sugar, cream of tartar or
glucose, in proper proportions, and careful boiling up to
the standard, the addition of borax is unnecessary and
should only be resorted to under special circumstances.</p>


<h3>PLAIN TAFFY.</h3>

<p>14 lbs. White Sugar.<br />
2 quarts Water.<br />
&frac12; ounce Cream Tartar.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;This is an easy and capital recipe to begin
with. The process is practically the same as for all
other clear goods, but the ingredients being fewer there
is little chance of their getting complicated. With a
thermometer it is hardly possible to make a mistake,
besides it will make the instruction more intelligible:
should he not possess this appliance, we must ask that
the instructions "How to boil sugar" should be committed
to memory, as it would be tedious and a great
waste of time and space to keep explaining how to tell
the different degrees through which the sugar passes
before it comes to the point required for the different
goods given in this book. For this and other reasons I
will assume the learner to be working with one.</p>

<p>Put the sugar and water in a clean pan, place it on
the fire and stir it occasionally till melted; when it
comes to the boil add the cream of tartar and put a lid
on the pan; allow it to boil in this way for ten minutes,
remove the lid and immerse the bottom part of the
thermometer in the boiling liquid and allow it to remain
in this position until it records 310 degrees, then quickly
take out the thermometer, lift off the pan and pour contents
into frames, tins, or on a pouring slab, which have
been previously oiled. If on a pouring slab, mark the
boil into bars or squares, while warm, with a knife or
taffy cutter: when quite cold it is ready for sale.</p>


<h3>LEMON TAFFY.</h3>

<p>
14 lbs. White Sugar.<br />
&frac12; ounce Cream Tartar.<br />
Saffron Coloring.<br />
2 quarts Water.<br />
Lemon Flavoring.<br />
</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Proceed as directed for plain taffy.
When the sugar reaches 305 degrees, add a few drops
of saffron color; when it reaches 310 degrees, add a few
drops of oil of lemon and pour out immediately into
frames or tins; or if on pouring slab, mark out into bars
or squares before it gets cold. The pouring slab should
be level so that the sheet should be all the same
thickness.</p>


<h3>BUTTER SCOTCH.</h3>

<p>
8 lbs. White Sugar.<br />
1 lb. Fresh Butter.<br />
Lemon Flavoring.<br />
&frac14; oz. Cream of Tartar.<br />
1 quart Water.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Melt the sugar in the water by an
occasional stir when the pan is on the fire, then add the
cream of tartar and boil up to 300, lift the pan on to the
side of the furnace and add butter in small pieces broken
off by the hand; slip the pan on the fire again, adding
the lemon flavoring; let it boil through so that all the
butter is boiled in then pour into frames; when partly
cold mark with cutter into small squares; when cold
divide the squares; wrap each in wax-paper; sold
generally in one cent packages.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;There is good butter scotch and better butter
scotch, but no bad butter scotch; this quality may be
improved by the addition of a large proportion of butter:
some makers would put 2 lbs. or even 3 lbs. to this
quantity, but that would be regulated by the class of
trade and the size squares. These frames are made to
hold 144 squares; a boil this size will make each square
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>weigh about 1 oz., but any weight of square may be
arranged by the adding or deducting from the boil.</p>


<h3>EVERTON TAFFY.</h3>

<p>
12 lbs. White Sugar.<br />
2 lbs. Dark Sugar.<br />
2 lbs. Fresh Butter.<br />
&frac12; oz. Cream of Tartar.<br />
2 quarts Water.<br />
Lemon Flavoring.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Melt the sugar in the water, add the
cream of tartar and boil the whole to the degree of
300; lift the pan on the side of the fire put in the butter
in small pieces, place the pan again on the fire and let
it boil through; add the lemon and give it time to mix
in, then pour out contents into frame, or on pouring
plate to cut up into bars. Everton taffy and butter
scotch are similar, except in color; same remarks as to
quality will apply in both cases; if the fire is very
fierce, do not put the pan down flat on it after adding
butter; nurse it gently to prevent burning; little fresh
coke shaken over the fire would assist.</p>


<h3>RASPBERRY TAFFY.</h3>

<p>
14 lbs. White Sugar.<br />
&frac12; oz. Cream of Tartar.<br />
Raspberry Flavor.<br />
2 quarts Water.<br />
Brilliant Rose.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Bring the sugar and water to a boil,
add the cream of tartar, put on the lid for ten minutes,
then uncover and immerse the thermometer; continue
to boil to 300; tinge a bright red with liquid, brilliant
rose; add raspberry essence; pour out on frame or
pouring plate and mark into bars or squares of convenient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>size; when cold the taffy is ready for packing
and sale.</p>


<h3>FIG TAFFY.</h3>

<p>
10 lbs Good Yellow Sugar.<br />
2 lbs. Glucose.<br />
3 lbs Figs Chopped Fine.<br />
3 pints Water.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Boil the sugar, water and glucose to a
weak crack, 295; lift the pan partly off the fire, putting
a piece of iron under it to prevent it burning; add the
figs, gently letting the whole thoroughly boil through
and mix; pour in oiled tins or on slab, and mark into
squares. When adding the figs let them drop through
the fingers, not in a heap.</p>


<h3>WALNUT TAFFY.</h3>

<p>
5 lbs. Brown Sugar.<br />
5 lbs. Crystal Sugar.<br />
2&frac12; lbs. Glucose.<br />
3 lbs. Walnuts.<br />
2 quarts Water.<br />
Lemon Flavoring.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Shell the walnuts, peel off the skin chop
very fine. Boil the glucose, sugar and water as before
directed to the degree of weak crack, 300. Lift the pan
a little from the fire; add the prepared nuts by letting
them run through the finger gently; let the whole boil
through, then add a few drops of the oil of lemon; when
thoroughly mixed in, pour out the boil and mark into
bars before too cold. The flavor is improved by roasting
the walnuts a little before putting in the boil.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>
<h3>PEANUT CANDY.</h3>

<p>Boil to the crack, 1 quart best New Orleans
Molasses, 1 lb. glucose and 1 quart water.</p>

<p>Prepare the meats by removing the thin reddish
skin in which they are enveloped and fill a tray to about
the depth of an inch. Pour over them the hot candy
prepared as directed, stirring the meats till each one is
covered. A little less candy should be used than will
suffice to entirely cover the meats, though each separate
one should be covered, the object being to use just enough
of the candy to cause the meats to adhere firmly together,
thus forming a large cake, which when nearly
cold may be divided into squares or bars with a sharp
knife.</p>

<p>Almonds and other nuts may be used in the same
manner above described.</p>


<h3>BARCELONA TAFFY.</h3>

<p>
5 lbs. Brown Sugar.<br />
5 lbs. Crystal Sugar.<br />
3 lbs. Barcelona Nuts.<br />
2 lbs. Glucose.<br />
2 quarts Water.<br />
Lemon Flavoring.<br />
</p>

<p>Prepare the nuts by chopping them fine, boil the
sugar, glucose and water to the degree 300. Remove
the pan a little from the fire add the nuts carefully;
when thoroughly boiled through and amalgamated, add
a few drops of lemon and pour out contents into frame
or on pouring plate and mark into bars.</p>


<h3>COCOANUT TAFFY.</h3>

<p>
6 lbs. Granulated Sugar.<br />
2 lbs. Desiccated Cocoanut Unsweetened.<br />
4 lbs. Brown Sugar.<br />
2 lbs. Glucose.<br />
3 pints Water.<br />
Lemon Flavoring.<br />
</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Melt the sugars in the water, bring it to
the boil, add the glucose and continue to boil to the
degree 300; lift the pan a little way from the fire; let
the desiccated cocoanut run gently in the boil; continue
to boil until the lot is well mixed through; add a few
drops of oil of lemon and pour out in frames; use the
lemon cautiously, too much spoils the flavor.</p>

<h3>EGGS AND BACON.</h3>

<p>
10 lbs. White Sugar.<br />
2&frac12; lbs. Glucose.<br />
3 pints Water.<br />
1 lb. Nonpareils.<br />
1 Cocoanut.<br />
Brilliant Rose Coloring.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Cut a large cocoanut into slices, dry them
and lay them on the pouring plate in rows about half an
inch apart; sprinkle between them thickly some nonpareil
of various colors (hundreds and thousands). Boil
to crack the sugar, glucose and water; tinge with
brilliant rose, and carefully and evenly pour the contents
over the pouring plate, disturbing the nut and
nonpareil as little as possible. A good plan is to have a
small shallow ladle with an open spout, into which pour
a little of the boil, run over the plate a small stream
from the ladle first, this will bind the nut, etc., and keep
them in their places while the bulk is being poured out.</p>


<h3>ALMOND HARDBAKE.</h3>

<p>
10 lbs. Good Brown Sugar.<br />
2 lbs. Glucose.<br />
Lemon Flavoring if desired.<br />
3 lbs. Almonds.<br />
3 pints water.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Split with a sharp knife the almonds, lay
them face downwards on an oiled plate, cover the plate
as closely as possible; boil the glucose, sugar and
water to the crack 305; remove the pan from the fire,
and pour the contents carefully and evenly over the
almonds; the addition of a little lemon or almond flavoring
will improve it.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;See remarks re-ladle in previous recipe.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<h3>ALMOND ROCK.</h3>

<p>
10 lbs. Brown Sugar.<br />
2 lbs. Glucose.<br />
6 lbs. Sweet Almonds.<br />
3 pints water.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Clean your almonds by blowing out all the
dust and grit, pick out the shells, dissolve the sugar water
and glucose; boil the lot up to crack; pour the contents
on oiled plate. Sprinkle the almond all over the boil,
shake over the lot a few drops of oil of lemon; turn up
the edges first, then the whole boil; mix and knead it
like dough until all the almonds are well mixed in; no
time must be lost in this process or the sugar will get
too hard; when firm make a long roll of the entire boil,
place it on a hard wood board, and cut it up into thin
slices; it will have to be kept in shape while cutting, by
turning over and pressing the sides as it becomes flat;
a special large sharp knife is used for this purpose. A
smaller boil than the above had better be tried by beginners,
say half the quantity. This can be done by halving
the ingredients. Needless to state these remarks apply
to other recipes.</p>


<h3>FRENCH ALMOND ROCK.</h3>

<p>
12 lbs. White Sugar.<br />
3 lbs. Glucose.<br />
6 lbs. Sweet Blanched Almonds.<br />
4 pints water.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Boil the sugar, water and glucose in
the usual way to the degree of weak crack, 305
by the thermometer, then ease the pan a little
way off the fire, and let the almonds gently slide
into the mass. Use the spatula a little just to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>keep the almonds from sticking to the bottom,
stirring lightly only the one way, then watch the boil
carefully till it turns a light golden color; lift off the pan
and pour the contents into the frames. The almond will
come to the top better in tins than in pouring plates.</p>

<p>Of course a better quality is made by adding more
almonds, or vice versa. The almond after being
blanched should be spread on a tin and dried, either on
the stove top or in the oven.</p>


<h3>RASPBERRY CANDY.</h3>

<p>
12 lbs. White Sugar.<br />
3 lbs. Raspberry Jam.<br />
2 quarts water.<br />
Brilliant Rose Coloring.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Melt the sugar in water, and boil
to ball 250; add the raspberry jam, and stir
it well in; remove the pan from the fire, add
sufficient coloring to make bright raspberry; rub
part of the mixture with spatula against side of
pan until it changes a heavy opaque, then stir
the whole mass until uniform. Pour the contents carefully
on a slab, covered with greased paper; make the
sheet about &frac12; inch thick, mark into bars with a sharp
knife, and break up when cold.</p>


<h3>APRICOT CANDY.</h3>

<p>
6 lbs. White Sugar.<br />
2 lbs. Apricot Jam or Pulp.<br />
2 pints water.<br />
Saffron Coloring.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Melt the sugar in the water and boil to
ball, 250, add the jam or pulp. Stir well until thoroughly
mixed in, remove the pan, rub part of the contents
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>against the side of the pan with spatula until cloudy and
opaque; color with saffron a bright yellow, then stir the
whole together until uniform cloudy; pour out in frames
or on slab covered with oiled paper. A pinch of
tartaric acid would improve the flavor, but often prevent
candying, unless in the hands of an expert. In any
case the acid should be added in a fine powder after the
whole has been thoroughly grained. A pallette knife is
a very useful knife for rubbing the sugar against the
sides of the pan.</p>


<h3>BROWN COCOANUT CANDY.</h3>

<p>
14 lbs. Brown Sugar.<br />
6 large Cocoanuts Sliced.<br />
3 pints water.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Melt the sugar in the water, and boil to
degree of ball, then add the sliced cocoanut, stir them in
remove the pan from the fire and rub the sugar against
the side of the pan until it becomes cloudy stir the whole
together until the whole becomes cloudy and thick; turn
out the batch into tins or on slabs; mark with a sharp
knife into squares or bars. When cold break it up at
marks. Prepare the cocoanuts by cutting them up into
thin slices with a spokeshave or machine. The brown
skin is seldom skinned off for this dark candy.</p>


<h3>WHITE COCOANUT CANDY.</h3>

<p>
14 lbs. White Sugar.<br />
6 Large Cocoanuts Peeled and Sliced.<br />
3 pints Water.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Peel off all the brown skin from the nuts
with a sharp knife; wash them and cut into thin slices.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>Melt the sugar in the water and boil to ball 250, add the
sliced nuts, keeping the boil well stirred. When thoroughly
mixed, remove the pan from the fire and commence to
grain with pallette knife or spatula until the whole mass
turns an opaque white. Now turn out the batch into
frames, or on the slab, which has been covered with
paper; mark into convenient sized bars, break up when
set hard.</p>


<h3>CHOCOLATE COCOANUT CANDY.</h3>

<p>
10 lbs. Brown Sugar.<br />
1 lb. Pure Block Cocoa.<br />
4 Cocoanuts shredded.<br />
3 pints water.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;When cracking the nuts, do so over a
basin and save all the milk: peel all brown skin off
and cut the nut into fine shreds with machine; dissolve
the sugar in the pan with the water and cocoanut milk,
boil up to ball, remove the pan a little off the fire, then
add the nut together with the pure block cocoa, stir
the whole together, grain on side of pan as before directed.
Stir the whole well up and turn out into frames
or on pouring plates.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;The pure cocoa should have been previously
melted in a saucepan or chopped up in small pieces.
In the latter case there is less waste, and the heat
of the sugar would soon melt it.</p>


<h3>FRUIT CANDY.</h3>

<p>
7 lbs. White or Brown Sugar.<br />
1 lb. Currants cleaned and dried.<br />
&frac12; lb. Sultanas.<br />
&frac12; lb. Sweet Almonds.<br />
2 pints water.<br />
Saffron Coloring.<br />
</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Mix together the fruits, which should
have been freed from grit and dust; boil the sugar and
water to the degree of ball, 250; remove the pan from
the fire; gently grain the boil by rubbing a little of the
syrup against the side of the pan until cloudy, then
slide in the fruit and stir the whole together, adding a
little saffron to color a bright yellow. See that the
mass has changed to an opaque, then turn the lot out
into frames or on a pouring slab.</p>


<h3>CANDIES, VARIOUS.</h3>

<p>Fruits green, dried or preserved, almonds and
nuts of almost every description, as well as flavors and
colors of a pleasant taste and pretty hue may be used
in making candies. The process is exactly the same:
the ingredients can be arranged to suit the fancy of the
maker and the palate of his customers. The field to
select variety from seems inexhaustible, so that new
goods of this class should be introduced ad. lib. No
good purpose could be served by giving a procession of
these simple instructions, when with little thought and
judgment anyone could invent a new candy for themselves.
It might be as well to add that a little glucose
or cream of tartar added will make the candies softer,
and may be used, if preferred, in each formula in the
proportion of 2 lbs. of glucose or a teaspoonful of cream
tartar to every 10 lbs. of sugar.</p>

it on the fire, giving it an occasional stir until the
sugar is dissolved, then add the glucose, or &frac14; oz. cream
of tartar&mdash;either will do, but do not use both&mdash;place
the cover on the pan and let it boil for ten minutes or
so, (the cover is put on to steam the sides of the pan
and keep it clean and free from granulation); take off
the cover and put in the thermometer, immersing the
bottom part in the boiling liquid. Let the whole boil
until it reaches the degree of crack, 300; tinge with
saffron, then pour the contents on pouring plate, which
has been previously oiled; sprinkle a few drops of oil
of lemon over it, turn the edges as it begins to cool:
then turn it over, knead it up as soon as you can handle
it: if it is on a cool slab you must be pretty smart or it
will get too hard. As soon as it gets stiff enough cut
off small convenient pieces and pass through the barley
sugar machine; when cool break up, give them a good
shake in a rough sieve to free them from any machine
scraps; the drops are then ready for bottling. Powdered

pan, add the cream of tartar and boil up sharply to a
weak crack, 300; pour the batch on oiled slab; turn in
the edges, fold the boil over, then put in powdered acid
with a few drops of lemon; knead the whole together,
working one end down to a point; draw it out the
required thickness, the full length of the plate, cut it
off, then do another length likewise, repeating the operation
until the boil is worked up; keep the first piece in
shape by occasionally rolling them while the remainder
of the boil is being pulled out and shaped. When the
boil is finished, and the sticks cold, snip them off in
lengths with scissors. An assistant is very useful to
keep the sticks in motion while the boil is being worked
up or they may become flat.</p>


<h3>PEPPERMINT STICKS.</h3>

<p class="center">Dark brown with light stripes.</p>

<p>
8 lbs. Brown Sugar.<br />
2 lbs. Glucose.<br />
3 pints Water.<br />
Peppermint Flavoring.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Bring the sugar, glucose and water to
the degree of crack in the usual way; pour the batch
on the slab; work in the flavors; cut off a piece about
1&frac12; pounds from the boil and pull it over hook until
light and satiny, then roll the pulled sugar out into a
long stick, cut it into six pieces of equal length and lay
them on the solid boil longways and equal distances
apart, then roll the boil into shape, bring down one end
to a point; pull out into convenient lengths, twisting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>them so that the stripes form a pretty spiral round the
stick.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;For the stripes in this case, white sugar is
often used and looks much better, but to do so two pans
are necessary, one may be a small saucepan to boil two
pounds. The white sugar is boiled separately in the
ordinary way, otherwise, process, would be exactly as
described.</p>

bright pan and bring to a boil, then add the glucose:
put on the lid for five minutes, continue boiling in the
usual way till it reaches crack 300; now add sufficient
coloring to tinge a golden color and pour the boil carefully
over the smooth slab, so that the sheet of sugar
will not be more than the eighth of an inch thick.
When the sheet has partly set, cut it into strips one
inch wide and the whole length of the sheet with scissors.
Let an assistant take charge of the strips and
twist them by taking hold of an end in each hand and
turn them in opposite directions, forming a spiral
column; when cold snip the required lengths and carefully
weigh and bottle. To make these goods the
operators must be very quick in their movements.
The slab must be warm on which the sugar is poured,
as the thin sticks cool so fast and get brittle.</p>


<h3>PEPPERMINT BULL'S EYES.</h3>

<p class="center">For cornered drops cut at angles, black with white stripes.</p>

peppermint stick, viz; boil the sugar water and glucose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>to weak crack, 300; pour the boil on oiled plate, flavor with
peppermint and work well up; in a smaller pan have
two pounds of white sugar, with the usual proportion of
cream of tartar and water boiled to the same degree;
pull this over the hook until white and porous; remove
it to the plate and work it down into lengths about one
inch thick; lay them longways on the solid boil, equal
distances apart; make the whole boil into a thick roll,
bringing one end down to a point; draw off as for one
cent sticks, but thicker; then with scissors snip them
off in pieces about an inch long. Hold the scissors in
the right hand, the sugar in the left; every time you
make a clip turn the sugar half way round, so that the
corners of each cushion will be at opposite angles.</p>


<h3>BULL'S EYES, (Various.)</h3>

<p>The formula given for the different kinds of sugar
sticks will answer for the variety of bull's eyes. The
process and ingredients are precisely alike. The sticks
may or may not be drawn out a little thicker, according
to the size of drop required. Cream of tartar may
be substituted for glucose in all recipes given for boiled
goods. The sugar is not boiled quite so high for hand
goods or pulled sugar as it is for machine drops; being
a little lower it works better, keeps longer pliable, and
is less brittle when cold.</p>

<h3>Jackson Ball Cutter.</h3>

<p>This Machine has two steel

of any size.</p>

<p>This general recipe will apply to all balls. For
details of pulling, striping, casing and variety the
reader is referred to the various processes given for
sticks and bulls eyes. They are all made and finished
in this way. For small sizes, pull out the lengths thinner;
for large sizes, thicker.</p>

<p>To make the various striped balls nicely, requires
practice and a good deal of it. No amount of book learning
will teach those who are quite ignorant of sugar boiling;
but at the same time if the reader has mastered
the simpler process at the beginning of the book, he is
quite capable of understanding this and working out
his own ideas in this way; but hand-made balls should
not be attempted until the learner feels confident he
can manage a boil easily and quickly, because there is
no time to think after the sugar is on the slab. The
manipulation must now have been acquired to an extent
so as to enable the operator to proceed as if by
instinct.</p>


<h3>ROSE BUDS.</h3>

<p>
8 lbs. White Sugar.<br />
2 pounds glucose.<br />
5 or 6 drops Otto of Roses.<br />
3 pints water.<br />
Cherry Paste Color.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Boil the sugar, glucose and water to the
degree of crack 300, pour on oiled slab, cut off about
one third for pulling, color the larger piece a deep red
and flavor with otto of roses; pull the smaller piece
over the hook till white; spread out the larger piece,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>lay the pulled sugar in the middle, casing carefully
round, pass through small acid drop rollers.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;Turn the boil on its edge every time you
cut a piece for the machine, in order to keep the pulled
sugar as near the centre as possible.</p>


<h3>RIPE PEARS.</h3>

<p>
8 lbs Sugar.<br />
2 lbs. Glucose.<br />
3 pints water.<br />
1 oz. Tartaric Acid.<br />
Cherry Red.<br />
Yellow Paste Color.<br />
&frac14; oz. Essence Pear.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Melt the sugar in the water, add the
glucose and boil to 305; pour on slab, cut the batch
into three equal parts, flavor with essence of pear,
together with a little acid, color one part deep red and
one deep yellow, pull the third portion over the hook
and lay it between the yellow and red pieces so that
one side will be yellow and the other bright red; cut
off into convenient sizes and pass through large pear
drop rollers. These goods are sold either plain or
crystalized.</p>


<h3>BOILED SUGAR TOYS.</h3>

<p>See our stock of clear toy moulds, list of which is
mailed on application. They may be had to turn out
all kinds of figures, such as dogs, cats, elephants, etc.
They are very popular among the children and sell
well in certain districts, and show a handsome profit.
The moulds are generally made in two parts; they
must be well oiled; the sugar boiled as for drops. Fill
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>the moulds full, and just before the whole mass sets,
pour as much of the sugar out as will run; this will
leave only a thin coating which cling to the sides of the
shapes and will easily come out when the mould is
parted, then you have the figures complete but hollow.
Boiled sugar whistles are made exactly the same way.</p>


<h3>TO CRYSTALIZE BOILED SUGAR GOODS.</h3>

<p>Several descriptions of boiled sugars are sold
crystalized, which look very pretty and stand exposure
to the atmosphere better. The process is very simple
and may be done with little trouble. When the drops
have been made and set, break them up and sift them
well in a coarse sieve, now shake them over a pan
which is boiling, so that they get damped by steam,
and throw them in a heap of crystal sugar; mix them
well up, so that the sugar adheres to the drops uniformly:
now sift them out of the sugar again and they will
dry in a few minutes and be ready for packing.
Another method is, when the drops have been made
and sifted, to have a thin solution of gum or gelatine
and shake it over them and rub them all together till
damp all over; now throw over them sufficient crystal
sugar to coat them and mix them up; when dry sift
again and pack.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;-When being crystalized the goods should
be warm, not hot, or they will candy. Large French
pears should be crystalized by the latter process and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>be almost cold during the operation; being bulky they
retain the heat a long time, and therefore have a great
tendency to grain.</p>


<h3>IMITATION INDIAN CORN.</h3>

<p>
8 lbs. White Sugar.<br />
2 lbs. Glucose.<br />
Yellow Color.<br />
3 pints Water.<br />
Lemon Flavoring.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Boil the sugar, glucose and water to
weak crack, 305; pour the boil on slab, flavor with
lemon and color yellow; cut this boil in two and pull
one-half over the hook; roll the pulled half out in
lengths about the size of a corn pod; now put the plain
yellow sugar through the Tom Thumb drop rollers,
loosening the screws a little, and ease the pulled sugar
with sheets from the machine; if done carefully, the
result will be a good imitation of real Indian corn.</p>


<h3>POPCORN BALLS.</h3>

<p>Roast the corn berries over a smokeless fire in a
corn popper (get our price for corn poppers); keep shaking
until every berry has burst; boil sufficient sugar
and water to the degree of feather, 245; add to each 7
lbs. syrup, four ounces of dissolved gum arabic; wet the
popped corn in this syrup, and roll them in fine
pulverized sugar until coated all over, then lay them
aside; when dry repeat the coating process in the same
manner until they have taken up the desired thickness
of sugar. Weigh or measure sufficient coated berries,
according to size of ball required, moisten them with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>thin syrup, partly form the ball by hand, then put it in
a pop corn ball press and press tightly into shape, then
form into balls in the usual way with pop corn ball press.</p>

fact the manipulation is practically all done by
mechanism. There is the desiccator for preparing the
cocoanuts, the steam pans, which are fitted with beaters
revolving inside, fixed with chains and weights for
lifting them out, so that the cans may be emptied and
cleaned without trouble; also plates for rolling out sheets
to size, and cutting machines which cut the nuggets
any size, the machine being so arranged that by simply
altering a pawl on a ratchet wheel the size of the
nuggets is determined. Where this elaborate arrangement
exists our formula would neither be desirable nor
necessary, nor do we pretend to suggest or advise.

<h3>JAP NUGGETS NO. 3.</h3>

<p>
4 lbs. Good Brown Sugar.<br />
3&frac12; lbs. Glucose.<br />
3 pints Water.<br />
4 lbs. Desiccated Cocoanut Unsweetened.<br />
2 lbs. Farina.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;As before, brown coloring should be
used if required dark; it makes goods look richer;
when the boil is cut up the nuggets should be thrown
into pulverized sugar.</p>


<h3>VANILLA NOUGAT (Common.)</h3>

<p>
12 lbs. White Sugar.<br />
3 lbs. glucose.<br />
&frac12; oz. Essence Vanilla.<br />
4 lbs. Sweet Almonds small.<br />
3 pints water.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Put the sugar, glucose and water in a
clean pan, place it on a sharp fire and stir until dissolved;
then put on the cover and let it boil for five or six
minutes; now remove the lid and continue to boil to
soft ball degree; now pour the contents on a damp
slab (one over which water has been sprinkled); when
cool take a long flat spatula and work the sugar about
until it becomes white and creamy; now add the
almonds (which have been previously blanched and
dried), together with the vanilla essence; keep working
up the whole until of uniform consistency; now spread
the mass on wafer paper in sheets one inch thick, cover
the sheets with wafer paper, rolling the top smooth;
when set cut into bars. Should the cream be a little
thin add some icing sugar when mixing; if boiled
properly this is not required. Most cheap Nougats now
in the market are made more or less according to this
formula, color and flavor differently for variety.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<h3>ICE CREAM CONFECTIONERY.</h3>

<p>Boil 7 lbs. of loaf sugar with three pints of water:
add a small teaspoonful of cream of tartar, allow it to
boil for 10 minutes, then add one pound of fresh butter:
it will then commence to froth up, and care must be
taken that the pan is large enough, as the syrup will
occupy twice the space than if there had been no butter
added; boil this mixture to the degree of very weak
crack, or 285 by the thermometer, at which point it is
done; pour it on the slab, which has been of course
previously greased. As soon as it begins to cool, turn
it up and knead it until it gets stiff enough to pull over
the hook. When on the hook pull it sharp till it gets
white as snow. This white is usually flavored with
vanilla or oil of lemon. It may be either pulled out in
bars or left in the heap. It is very easily broken in
small pieces for retail purposes. In the summer or hot
weather keep this candy from the air, or it will be
inclined to be sticky. This eats very rich and commands
good sale at best prices.</p>


<h3>RASPBERRY AND STRAWBERRY ICE CREAM CONFECTIONERY.</h3>

<p>This is made exactly as the last with the addition
of a little red color before the boil is poured out, or it
may be colored on the slab; add a little essence of raspberry
or strawberry and a pinch of tartaric acid just
before pulling the boil. Color the raspberry a little
deeper than the strawberry.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM.</h3>

<p>To make chocolate ice cream, boil the same quantities
as before precisely in the same way in every particular.
When the sugar has been pulled out, work well
into it &frac12; lb. powdered chocolate; knead this well up in
order that the chocolate may be well mixed with the
sugar. Put in sufficient chocolate to give the boil a
dark brown color, otherwise it would be too light when
pulled.</p>


<h3>VANILLA CARAMELS.</h3>

<p>
8 lbs. White Sugar.<br />
2 lbs. Glucose.<br />
1 lb. Fresh Butter.<br />
2 Tins Condensed milk.<br />
2 pints water.<br />
Vanilla Flavoring.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Boil the sugar, glucose and water to
the degree of ball 250; remove the pan a little from
the fire, add the milk and butter, the latter cut into
little pieces and well stir in with wooden spatula until
the whole is thoroughly mixed, then gently bring the
mass through the boil and pour out on greased slab,
making the sheet about &frac12; inch thick; when set cut with
caramel cutter, and when cold separate the squares
and wrap in wax paper.</p>


<h3>COCOANUT CARAMELS.</h3>

<p>

2 pints water.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Melt the sugar in the water, add the
glucose and boil up to ball 250; remove the pan to side,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>then stir in the butter, milk and cocoanut, bring
through the boil, pour on slab or in frames about &frac12; inch
thick; when set mark with caramel cutter; when cold
separate and wrap in wax paper.<br /><br /></p>

2 tins Condensed Milk.<br />
2 pints Water.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;As above, caramels require careful
watching and a lot of stirring, the boil being liable to
catch and flow over; fire must not be too fierce; when
too hot put an iron under one side of the pan to keep it
up a little from the fire; keep constantly on the stir
after butter and flavoring ingredients are added.</p>

<p>By using pure maple, maple caramels may be made
precisely as vanilla; the flavor of the maple sugar is
sufficient without any artificial essence. These caramels
will of course be dark.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<h3>UNWRAPPED CARAMELS.</h3>

<p>Caramels have usually been sold wrapped in wax
paper. This is necessary when the goods are boiled

<h3>BUTTERCUPS.</h3>

<p>These beautiful candies are very popular; they
are pleasing both to the eye and the palate when they
are well made, but they must be kept air tight or they
will soon lose all their attractiveness and become a
sticky mass, as they have a great tendency to "sweat."
In order to prevent this as much as possible it is advisable
to use a little borax in each boil. The process is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>simple enough, but must be worked quickly, in fact
the beauty depends upon the rapid manipulation of the
sugar over the hook; keep the eye fixed on the color;
as soon as it becomes a glossy satin with a close grain
it is finished; lift it off the hook immediately and return
to the slab for casing. Do not carry on the pulling
operation until it becomes spongy, and be careful not
to use too much color; the tints should be light and
delicate when finished. Machines are made for cutting
buttercups, price $6.00 and $14.00, each machine.
Crimped edge machine, $20.00 each. <i>Get our price list.</i></p>


<h3>VANILLA BUTTERCUPS.</h3>

<p>
7 lbs. Best White Sugar.<br />
2 lbs. Fondant Paste.<br />
1 lb. Desiccated Cocoanut, fine.<br />
Green color.<br />
1 teaspoonful Cream of Tartar.<br />
1 quart water.<br />
Borax.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Put the sugar, water and cream of tartar
in the boiling pan and boil up to crack 310 in the
ordinary way; while the pan is on the fire, take the
fondant paste and work into it the desiccated cocoanut,
with a little essence of vanilla, and lay aside till required.
When the boil has reached the required
degree pour the sugar on the slab, color it light green,
and when partly cool, pull over the hook until it becomes
a delicate satin tint; return it to the slab, press
the boil out, lay the fondant paste in the centre and
case it all around with the pulled sugar; now carefully
work the one end of the boil down to a point as for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>sticks and draw it out in lengths, required thickness:
lay them on the machine and press gently until cut
through; the buttercups are then ready for packing. It
is advisable to work small boils of these goods, as
the casing being boiled soon gets brittle; keep
turning the bulk round on the plate so as to keep the
fondant paste exactly in the centre.</p>

fondant paste, boil the sugar, water and cream tartar
to crack, and work off as already described.</p>


<h3>FONDANT CREAM WORK OR BUTTERCUP FILLING.</h3>

<p>This branch of the business has developed wonderfully
during the last few years. This cream is not
only moulded and worked into every conceivable shape,
size color and flavor by itself, but is used with chocolate,
fruits, etc., to make an endless variety of pleasing
and tasty confections. The smaller goods in this work
form the body, and sometimes the whole, of many
beautiful mixtures, and no window can now be considered
orthodox unless they have a good display of
these goods. For our purpose the variety is a matter
of detail which we only mention to remind the reader
that he must look for the greater part of it outside the
covers of this guide. The process is practically the
same all through; the mixing, flavors, colors and shapes
make whatever distinction there is. It will only be
necessary to give a fair selection of formulas to enable
the reader to imitate anything he sees in this line, or
invent something new.</p>

consistency to mould, add vanilla flavor and run it into
rubber moulds; now put the other portion in the pan
and remelt; color it a light pink; flavor with essence
of raspberry and mould in the same shapes; when the
goods are set and cold crystalize them with cold syrup.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;Have everything very clean when making
fondants; every speck will show; a touch of blue will
make the white a better color.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Select some large, preserved cherries,
cut them in half. Boil the sugar, glucose and water in
the ordinary way to ball degree, pour the batch on a
damp pouring plate; when nearly cold work up the
whole with spatula till it becomes a white glossy cream,
working the flavor in at the same time; then divide
into three equal portions, color one portion a bright
pink and another a yellow, leaving the third white;
knead each portion into stiff paste, adding a little icing
sugar to make it tough; pinch off small pieces and form
them into balls about the size of the cherry, make them
a little flat on one side; on this flat part stick a half
cherry, squeezing them into shape; place them in canvas
trays and put them in the drying room for a few
hours to harden; afterwards crystalize with cold syrup.
Other preserved fruits may be used in same way.</p>


<h3>FONDANTS FOR MIXTURES.</h3>

<p>
10 lbs. White Sugar.<br />
2&frac12; lbs. Glucose.<br />
Flavors Various.<br />
3 pints Water.<br />
Colors Various.<br />
</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Boil the sugar, glucose and water as
before directed to a stiff ball and pour the sugar on
damp slab; let it stand till nearly cold, then work it up
with spatula till glossy cream; divide the boil into as
many portions as you want colors; then remelt this
cream, color and flavor to fancy; run the batch into
moulds of different shapes. When the fondants are set,
crystalize in cold syrup. Fondants for mixture are
made a trifle harder to prevent being crushed with
other sweets with which they are mixed.</p>


<h3>TO CRYSTALIZE FONDANTS</h3>

<p>
13 lbs. Best White Sugar.<br />
4 pints Water.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Boil this quantity of sugar and water
for a few minutes, about 220 degrees by the thermometer;
stand it aside undisturbed till quite cold. Pack
the fondants in crystalizing tins, putting wire trays
between each layer of say two inches deep; let the
wire trays take a bearing on the ends of the tin;
when the tin is full, cover the goods with cold syrup,
putting a damp cloth over the top; stand the tins in a
cool place in the drying room about ten hours; then
remove them to a cold place; about an hour afterwards
take out the plugs and drain off the superfluous syrup;
when the fondants are dry, turn the tins on end, giving
them a slight knock and empty them on clean trays;
they will be ready for packing in an hour or so.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;If a thin skin forms over the top of the
syrup, skim it off before draining the goods; it may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>tend to granulate them, but the damp cloth ought to
prevent this skin forming.</p>


<h3>CHRISTMAS FANCIES&mdash;CLEAR TOY MOULDS.</h3>

<p>There are a great number of fancies made from
grain sugars sold about Christmas time. Their beauty
and attractiveness depends upon the moulds in which
they are moulded, and the taste displayed in painting
or decorating them. The goods themselves are quite a
secondary consideration, being so simple to make.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Boil 7 lbs. sugar, 1 lb. glucose, 2 pints
water in the usual way to the degree of ball 250, by
thermometer; remove it from the fire and rub the
sugar against the side of the pan until thick and white;
stir it all together, then fill the moulds through the
runner. Too much sugar must not be boiled at one
time, or it will set before it can be all run into the
moulds; two or three pounds will be enough for a
beginner to practice with. They will be hard enough
to be taken out of the moulds in fifteen to thirty minutes,
according to size after being run, and they will
be ready for decorating.</p>


<h3>ARTIFICIAL FIGURES.</h3>

<p>Fruit, eggs, and any object may be taken from
nature by this process, to be transformed into sugar,
afterwards glazed, colored to imitate nature so exactly
as to deceive many persons. Boil the sugar in exactly
the same way as directed in the previous recipe, grain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>it and fill the moulds; in a few minutes run out as
much sugar as will leave the mould; this will cause
the casting to be hollow in the centre. Allow your
articles to imitate the natural objects which they represent
with liquid colors and camel's hair pencils; if
gloss is required the colors should be mixed with a
strong solution of gum arabic or isinglass to the desired
tint.</p>

<h3>VANILLA CREAM BARS.</h3>

<p>
7 lbs. White Sugar.<br />
2 lbs. Glucose.<br />
3 pints Water.<br />
Vanilla Flavoring.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Dissolve the sugar with water in a clean
pan; add the glucose and boil in the usual way to the
degree of feather, 243; pour the contents on a damp
slab; let it remain a few minutes to cool; then with a
pallette knife work it up to white cream, adding a tint
of blue to bleach it; when the whole has become a
smooth cream, return it to the pan and melt it just
sufficient that it may pour out smooth and level; stir in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>the flavor and run on pouring plate &frac12; inch thick; when
set cut into bars.</p>


<h3>RASPBERRY OR ROSE CREAM BARS.</h3>

<p>
7 lbs. White Sugar.<br />
2 lbs. Glucose.<br />
3 pints Water.<br />
Raspberry or Rose Flavor.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Melt the sugar in the water, add the
glucose and boil to 243; pour contents on slab, and
when cool divide the boil into three parts; color one
part red, add some pure chocolate to another, and to a
third add a pinch of blue, cream each part by rubbing
on slab to a smooth paste; in rubbing in the pure chocolate,
see that you have enough to make it a rich brown;
for red portion use just sufficient to give a light rose
pink. When all finished, melt each portion separately
in the pan just sufficiently soft to run to a level surface;
pour out first the red, then the chocolate on top of red
sheet, then the white on top of chocolate; this will make
a cream cake to cut up into bars. Some do not take the
trouble to melt the cream, being satisfied to spread the
paste out, smoothing it on top with a pallette knife;
this answers the purpose but does not look so well.</p>


<h3>COCOANUT CREAM.</h3>

<p>
7 lbs. White Sugar.<br />
3 lbs. Cocoanut peeled and sliced.<br />
2 lbs. Glucose.<br />
Red Coloring.<br />
3 pints Water.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Boil the sugar, glucose and water in the
usual way to the degree 245; pour contents on slab;
divide the boil into two lots; when cool, color one part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>light pink and put a small touch of blue in the other;
add the sliced cocoanut, half into each part, then commence
to cream them by rubbing. When both parts
have been mixed into a smooth paste, it is ready for
sale, being usually sold by cutting from rough block.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;Cut almonds, ground walnuts, etc., are used
in the same way as directed for cocoanuts. The boils
may or may not be flavored, but a little improves it and
makes it fragrant.</p>


<h3>MAPLE CREAM.</h3>

<p>
8 lbs. Yellow Sugar.<br />
1 quart Sweet Cream.<br />
2 lbs. Glucose.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Boil the sugar, glucose and cream to 242 on
thermometer, stirring all the time; when done lift off
the fire and let stand till nearly cold (placing it where
it will cool quickly), then stir until it sets; then melt
over a slow fire (stirring constantly) until it becomes a
nice creamy consistency, pour on a well greased tin,
lay about one inch deep, let stand till cold, when by
turning over the tin it will fall out. After the batch is
set to cool in the tin, on no account disturb it as it will
make the cream crack into pieces when turning out.
If this is too expensive a recipe use milk instead of
cream and add half a pound of butter.</p>


<h3>CHRISTMAS PUDDING (IMITATION).</h3>

<p>
7 lbs. White Sugar.<br />
1 lb. Raisins.<br />
&frac12; lb. Sweet Almonds blanched chopped.<br />
1 lb. Currants.<br />
1 lb. Sultanas.<br />
&frac12; lb. Mixed Peel.<br />
1 oz. Mixed Spice.<br />
2 pints Water.<br />
</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Prepare fruit by washing currants in
cold water, afterwards drying them; stone raisins;
blanch and chop almonds; cut the peel in stripes, then
mix them together, adding the spice; boil the sugar and
water to ball degree; remove the pan from the fire:
grain the boil by rubbing the syrup against the side of
the pan in the usual way; when it becomes creamy,
add the mixed fruit, carefully stirring the whole until
thoroughly incorporated; have some wet cloths ready,
into which divide the boil; tie them very tight and
hang them up until set hard. The blanched almonds
are used to represent suet and should be chopped
accordingly.</p>


<h3>BROWN CREAM PUDDING.</h3>

<p>
7 lbs. Brown Sugar.<br />
2 lbs. Glucose.<br />
1 lb. Currants.<br />
&frac12; lb. Sultanas.<br />
&frac12; lb. Raisins.<br />
&frac12; lb. Mixed Peel.<br />
&frac12; oz. Mixed Spice.<br />
2 pints Water.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Dissolve the sugar in the water and put
the pan on the fire and add the glucose; let the whole
boil to a stiff ball, then pour the contents on a damp
pouring plate; when nearly cold commence to cream by
rubbing and working it about the slab with pallette
knife until it becomes opaque, stiff and creamy, have
the fruit prepared and mix as in previous recipe, then
work them into the boil with spatula; now divide the
boil into small basins, holding about one pound each;
press the cream well down and let them remain till set.
Take them out, brush over them a thin solution of gum
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>and dust them with powdered sugar to represent frosting.
Before putting the cream in the basins, shake a
little icing sugar over the basins, it will keep them
from sticking.</p>


<h3>RASPBERRY NOYEAU.</h3>

<p>
5 lbs. White Sugar.<br />
1 lb. Glucose.<br />
2 lbs. Raspberry Jam.<br />
1 lb. Almonds, blanched and Dried.<br />
3 pints Water.<br />
Liquid Brilliant Rose Color.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Boil the sugar, glucose and water to the
ball degree, 250; ease the pan off the fire, add the jam
and almonds, with sufficient color to make the whole a
bright red; let the batch boil through, keeping it stirred
gently until thoroughly mixed; now remove the pan
from the fire and see if the batch has turned opaque; if
not rub some of the syrup against the side of the pan
and stir until whole boil shows a little creamy, then
pour out on wafer paper, keeping the sheet about three-quarters
of an inch thick; level the top down with pallette
knife and cover with wafer paper; when set remove
to a clean board and cut into bars with a sharp
knife. In running sheets to thickness, arrange the
loose bars on the pouring plate to form a square in proportion
to the size of the boil. Almost any kind of
jam can be substituted for flavoring Noyeau.</p>


<h3>WHAT TO DO WITH SCRAPS AND SIFTINGS.</h3>

<p>It is necessary to know how to use up the scraps,
siftings, spoiled boil candies and otherwise unsaleable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>goods. People who make jam or liquorice goods know
of course what to do with them; but small makers
often accumulate lots of waste which seems always in
the way. This should be avoided as much as possible,
not only on the ground of economy, but for the
good order and general appearance of the workshop.
Keep the acid scraps separate from the others; have
two pans (earthenware will do) and make it a rule,
when sweeping down the plates, to throw the acid
scraps into one pan and the others into the second pan;
keep them well covered with water, and, as the syrup
then gets too thick, put in more water in order that the
scraps may dissolve. When making dark goods such as
cough candy, cough drops, cocoanut candy, stick jaw,
etc., use a proportion of this syrup in each boil, dipping
it out with a ladle. As a rule a careful workman
would use up his scraps every day. Some use the
machine scraps by putting them in the next boil when
sugar is on the slab. The writer's experience is that
that method is objectionable, as it not only causes the
boil to be cloudy, but very often grains it. Melt the
acid scraps in water enough to form a thin syrup; put
in some whiting, powdered chalk or lime; put the pan
on the fire and stir until whole boils; see that all the
scraps are dissolved; remove the pan and let it stand
for an hour, then strain through flannel. Use this
syrup in the same way as the other for making common
goods.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<h3>CREAM FOR CHOCOLATE CREAMS OR BARS.</h3>

<p>
10 lbs. White Sugar.<br />
3 pints Water.<br />
2&frac12; lbs. Glucose.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Put the sugar, glucose and water in a
clean pan and boil in the usual way until the batch
reaches the degree of feather 245; (keep the sides of the
pan free from sugar); pour out on damp pouring plate
and let it remain till nearly cold; then with long pallette
knife commence to rub the sugar against the plate
and work it about until it changes from a clear syrup
to snow white creamy substance; then knead it with
the hand until of uniform softness and no lumps left in
the mass; it is now ready for use and may be kept
covered in stoneware jars until required for various
purposes. In winter the sugar need not be boiled so
high; in hot weather, a little higher. When packing
the cream away in jars it is better to keep the top
moist by laying on a damp cloth before putting in the
cork. Seeing that cream keeps so well, of course it is
saving to make much larger batches at a time. This
can be easily arranged by multiplying the proportions
according to size of pan and convenience. These proportions
are a guide, but the writer knows of no absolute
must be this or that, although he has made as many
cream goods as most people and with as much success.
He has seen as fine a sample made in the same
workshop when the boil was made up a little different.
However, in submitting his own formula, it may be
taken for granted he is not a mile from the bull's eye.<br /><br /></p>

<h3>CHOCOLATE CREAM BUNS AND CAKES.</h3>

<p>
10 lbs. Sugar.<br />
2&frac12; lbs. Glucose.<br />
3 pints Water.<br />
&frac12; oz. Vanilla Essence.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Boil the sugar, glucose and water in the
ordinary way to the strong feather 245, then pour on
damp slab, let it remain until nearly cold, add the
flavor, and with pallette knife work up the boil till
white and creamy; shape it with the hands or press
into tin moulds; stand it in a warm place to harden a
little on the outside. Melt some chocolate paste and
cover the goods smoothly with it, using either knife or
brush; when dry glaze them by brushing on a solution
of shellac dissolved in alcohol.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>
<p>N.B.&mdash;In this recipe the sugar is boiled higher
than the "Cream for Chocolate Cream," because the
goods are so large the soft cream would not keep in
shape. In melting pure chocolate simply put it in a
tin together with a piece of lard or cocoa butter, stand
it near the fire, give it an occasional stir; it will soon
dissolve; use no water or it will run to powder and be
spoiled.<br /><br /></p>

<h3>CHOCOLATE DROPS, PLAIN.</h3>

<p>Warm some sweet chocolate; when it is just sufficiently
heated to be pliable, pinch off little pieces, roll
them in the hands to size of a small marble; place them
in rows on sheets of white paper, each row about an
inch apart; when the sheet is covered, take it by the
corners and lift it up and down, letting it touch the

<h3>CHOCOLATE DROPS (NONPAREIL.)</h3>

<p>Process exactly as for plain drops. When the
drops have been flattened, cover the sheets of paper
entirely over with white nonpareil (hundreds and
thousands); when the drops are dry shake off the surplus
ones.</p>


<h3>CHOCOLATE CREAMS.</h3>

<p>Melt some cream (see "Cream for Chocolate Cream")
use the runner and fill the moulds; in an hour the
cream will be set hard enough to be taken out of the
moulds; they are then ready for coating. Warm some
sweet chocolate paste until melted, then drop the
creams into the melted chocolate, two or three at a
time; lift them out with a long fork and place them on
glazed paper or sheets of tin to dry; put them in a cool
place to harden; pack carefully in paper lined boxes in
such a manner that they hardly touch each other; if
packed roughly like most other candies, they become
spotted and rough, spoiling the appearance altogether.</p>

<p>Rubber moulds are now largely used for making
these goods; being much cleaner and very much easier
used than starch moulds, and for new beginners are
very much better than starch. These moulds are now
to be bought much cheaper than they were a few years
ago, the price now being about $1.40 per lb. These
moulds weigh about two pounds each and hold ninety
chocolate drops and can be refilled every half hour.
We would strongly advise the purchase of rubber
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>moulds, as besides the saving of time, neither starch
boards, starch, plaster moulds or bellows are required.
Fletcher Manfg Co., carry a full line of moulds for
chocolates and creams.</p>


<h3>CHOCOLATE FOR DIPPING.</h3>

<p>This mixing is so often required by confectioners
for so many purposes that a good general recipe will
not be out of place. If the instructions are followed and
a little discretion used with the colors, a light glossy
chocolate coating will be the result.</p>

<p>
1 lb. Pure Chocolate.<br />
3 oz. White Wax.<br />
Chocolate Brown Color.<br />
Cochineal.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Put the chocolate in a saucepan; stand
on the furnace plate or near a fire; break up the wax
into little pieces and stir it in until all is melted; then
add the brown color, with a little liquid cochineal,
stirring the whole until thoroughly mixed; it is then
ready for use. For cheap common goods, more wax
may be used. When mixing in the color try a little on
a piece of white paper until satisfied with the blend.</p>


<h3>GELATINE COCOANUT BARS (YELLOW).</h3>

<p>

<h3>PATENT RUBBER CANDY MOULDS</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
New Patterns.
</p>

<p>The best process in the world for making moulded Bon-bons or
French Creams and grained work, is by using Patent Rubber Candy
Moulds. They will entirely supplant the use of starch as a mould
for manufacturing such candies for the following reasons.</p>

<p>I.&mdash;Not alone can all the patterns at present made in starch be
reproduced in these moulds but also a large variety of others with a
perfection not before known, and which it would be impossible to
use in starch.</p>

<p>II.&mdash;A much superior quality of goods is produced, in as much
as the candies show as perfect a pattern as the moulds themselves.</p>

<p>III.&mdash;A saving at least 33 per cent is accomplished in labor.</p>

<p>IV.&mdash;No starch boards or starch is required, consequently the
filling, printing, sifting and blowing off are dispensed with&mdash;six
items of expense.</p>

<p>V.&mdash;The moulds specially facilitate the making of cream walnuts,
cream almonds and cream jellies and other combinations,
because the nuts, etc., can be pressed on the candy as soon as it has
been poured into the moulds. This cannot be done with starch
moulds, as any pressure on those will destroy the pattern.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>
<p>VI.&mdash;Casting into starch moulds requires considerable experience
and skill in order to do work well, while any workman can
turn out the most perfect work with the rubber moulds, without
any previous experience in such work.</p>

<p>VII.&mdash;A saving of room is effected, as a starch room is not
required and the capacity of the rubber moulds is so much greater
than starch boards of equal size that a comparatively less number
of moulds are required to produce an equal quantity of goods.</p>

<p>VIII.&mdash;No starch being used, the shop will remain much cleaner.</p>

<p>These moulds are made of Pure Para Rubber and will, with
proper usage last from twelve to fifteen years, judging from those
which have been in use for the past four years.</p>

<p>An objection which naturally suggests itself to a person who
has never tried these moulds, is that the candies might possibly
have some taste of the rubber. This is not the case, however.</p>

<p class="center">
NOT THE SLIGHTEST TASTE OF RUBBER
</p>

<p>is discernable. Not one of our many customers, either in this city
or throughout the country, has made a single complaint. This
proves that there is absolutely no difference between candies made
in rubber moulds and candies made in starch moulds.</p>

<p>The demand for these moulds increases every year.</p>

<p>WRITE FOR PRICES AND PARTICULARS.</p>

<p>Cream to be run in these moulds should be cooked one degree
lower than usual for starch.</p>

<p>Crystal &frac12; degree lower than usual for starch.</p>

<p>Before using New Moulds for first time, soak for half an hour
in strong common washing soda and water.</p></div>

<h3>JELLY FANCIES.</h3>

<p>
12 lbs. Sugar.<br />
7 lbs. Glucose.<br />
3 pints Water.<br />
3 lbs. Gelatine.<br />
2 oz. Tartaric Acid.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Soak gelatine in cold water for twelve
hours. Boil the sugar, glucose and water in the usual
way to the degree of ball; remove the pan from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>fire and stir in the gelatine gradually until dissolved;
let it stand for a few minutes; take off the scum as it
rises, then divide the boil, if required in more than one,
color and flavor each portion to fancy, then run the
boil in the moulds; when set put them on clean slab,
sprinkle some cold water over them and roll them
about until all are damped, then cover them with fine
crystal sugar and mix them up till crystalized all over,
and spread them out on trays to dry.</p>

<p>The different recipes already given will give the
reader a general idea how gelatine goods are made. By
using different colors, flavors and shapes an infinite
variety can be produced. It would serve no good purpose
to further multiply these formulas for small goods.</p>


<h3>JAM ROLEY POLEY.</h3>

<p>
10 lbs. White Sugar.<br />
5 lbs. Glucose.<br />
2 lbs Gelatine.<br />
Carmine Color.<br />
1 lb. Raspberry Jam.<br />
1 lb. Desiccated Cocoanut.<br />
3 pints Water.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Soak the gelatine in cold water for twelve
hours; boil the sugar, glucose and water sharply to
stiff ball; remove the pan from the fire, stir in the
gelatine, stand aside till scum rises and skim it off;
divide the boil into two portions, (mix together 1 oz.
tartaric acid, 1 oz. carbonate of soda, 2 oz. icing sugar);
drop this powder and the desiccated cocoanut into one
half of the boil and stir briskly until the whole rises in
a white foam, then run out into tins, on sheet about &frac14;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>inch thick; now take the other half, color bright red,
adding the raspberry jam; stir till thoroughly mixed
and run this on top of the white sheet about the same
thickness; when cold and hard, take out the sheets and
make a roll of each.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;Let the red portion be cool when run over
the white, as the white being lighter will come to the
top if disturbed by the mixture being too hot.</p>


<h3>RASPBERRY JELLIES.</h3>

<p>
9 lbs. White Sugar.<br />
6 lbs. Glucose.<br />
2 lbs. Apple Jelly.<br />
2&frac14; lbs. Gelatine.<br />
3 pints Water.<br />
2 oz. Tartaric Acid.<br />
&frac12; oz. Essence Raspberry.<br />
Carmine Color.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Soak the gelatine as usual; boil the
sugar, glucose and water to a stiff ball; remove the
pan from the fire; stir in the gelatine and let it remain
till scum rises; skim it off, then add jelly, acid and
flavor and sufficient color to make a bright red: now
mould the batch into Raspberry shapes and put them
in a cold place. When set stiff, put the goods in thin
layers in a crystalizing tin and cover them with cold
syrup. Let them remain undisturbed for twelve hours,
then drain off all the surplus syrup and turn the raspberries
on clean trays; when dry, pack.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;When putting jelly goods in tins, be careful
that the layers are not thick, as they lay so close that
the syrup cannot get in between them. A good plan is
to have wire trays and fix three or four loosely in each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>tin, taking their bearings on the ends of the crystalizing
tin. By this means you will get more in a tin
with better result. Boil the syrup in the proportion of
six pounds best white sugar to each quart water, to
the degree of smooth 215. It must be quite cold when
used for gelatine work or the goods will come out of
the tins in a solid block.</p>


<h3>BLACK CURRANT JELLIES.</h3>

<p>
9 lbs. White Sugar.<br />
6 lbs. Glucose.<br />
2&frac14; lbs. Gelatine.<br />
Purple Coloring.<br />
3 pints Water.<br />
2 oz. Tartaric Acid.<br />
2 lbs. Black Currant Jelly.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Soak gelatine as usual, smooth off and
mould fondant shapes. Boil the sugar, glucose and
water, as already directed, to a stiff ball; remove the
pan from the fire, drop in the gelatine, a few pieces at
a time, stir till dissolved. Let it remain a short time
till the scum rises; skim it off, then stir in the tartaric
acid, jelly and sufficient color to make the mixture a
bright color, then mould the batch. When the goods
are firmly set, place them in layers on wire frames
fitted for crystalizing pan; arrange the frames in the
tins and cover with cold syrup; let them stand for
twelve or fourteen hours undisturbed, then drain off the
surplus syrup; take them carefully out of the tins,
pack them on clean trays; when dry they are ready
for boxing. These goods require handling gently;
they are very delicate and easily crushed.</p>

<h3>BEST WAY TO CRYSTALIZE GUM GOODS.</h3>

<p>
13 lbs. Best White Sugar.<br />
2 quarts Water.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;Have the goods cleaned and put in
crystalizing tins; bring the above quantity of sugar and
water just to the boil and stand aside until only milk
warm; then pour it gently over the goods until covered;
then slip the hands into the middle of the goods, and
with the fingers just ease this bulk so that the syrup
will flow freely between them; withdraw the hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
carefully and cover the tin; do not again disturb it for
the next twelve hours, when the goods will be ready to
drain and dry. To an experienced man, this method
may seem a little dangerous and likely to spoil the
crystal; but it will not do so if done carefully. Of
course, it is understood the goods are not to be roughly
stirred up, but simply loosened.<br /><br /></p>

<h4>Transcriber's Note</h4>

<p>Misspelled words have been corrected. Punctuation in this book is
somewhat erratic; in general, this has not been altered from the
original. However, when punctuation clearly follows a specific pattern,
punctuation has been standardized.</p>

<p>In the recipe for <a href="#ACID_DROPS_AND_TABLETS">ACID DROPS AND TABLETS</a>, the original wording says to
"add the acid which has been finally powdered." Since this seems like a
typo, it has been changed to "finely powdered."</p>

<p>In the table of <a href="#COMPOSITION_CLEAR_TOY_MOULDS">COMPOSITION CLEAR TOY MOULDS</a>, the ones digit of the "No.
per lb." is unreadable for items 34 (Harp), 35 (Fireman), and 46
(Scissors). The numbers listed in that column for those items are
guesses.</p>

<p>In the recipe for <a href="#TAR_COUGH_DROPS">TAR COUGH DROPS</a>, the tar
referred to is probably pine tar.</p>
